      review="Althought the miso and pepper don't really jump out, the pastry as a whole still was very pleasant. It is crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and the taste is nicely balanced. Perhaps there is a slight umami undertone thanks to the miso."

      review="There was extra fig under the custard. The custard flavor was a bit subtle, and could have been more pronounced. The pastry itself was nice and flaky, but it was missing some wow."
